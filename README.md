## About This Project

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) with GitHub Copilot in a FastAPI application. The project is part of a GitHub Skills exercise to help you learn how to expand Copilot's capabilities using MCP.

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol for providing context and instructions to AI models, enabling more advanced and interactive workflows.

### What is Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and smarter.

### Exercise Steps
1. Review the FastAPI app in `src/app.py`.
2. Use Copilot to suggest improvements, add features, or automate tasks.
3. Optionally, extend the API to accept MCP-style context or instructions.
4. Document your changes and learning in this repository.

### Example: Extending the API for MCP
You can add endpoints or logic to accept MCP context payloads, or use Copilot to generate code based on MCP instructions.
